# langchain-nlp-vv

Built a question-answering (QA) system using LangChain and an open-source large language model (LLM) GPT-2.

This project successfully implemented a question-answering system using LangChain and an open-source LLM (GPT-2). The system can take a user’s question, retrieve relevant context, and provide a concise answer. Key improvements were achieved through the use of a custom prompt template and memory integration to retain conversation history. The report details:

Environment Setup: Documenting the installation of necessary libraries and tools.

LLM Integration: Utilizing Hugging Face's GPT-2 and LangChain to create a QA system.

Custom Prompt Design: Improving the LLM’s performance by structuring input through prompt templates.

Memory Integration: Enhancing the system’s interactivity by allowing follow-up questions and ongoing dialogue.
